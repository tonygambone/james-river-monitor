	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>This app tells you whether it's safe to be on the James River around Richmond, VA.</p>
	<p>According to <a href="http://www.richmondgov.com/parks/parkJamesRiverSystem.aspx">James 
		River Park System</a> rules, you need a life vest to be on the river
		if it is over 5 feet, and a high-water permit if it is over 9 feet. Measurements are taken
		at the Westham gauge, located just upstream of the Huguenot Bridge.</p>
	<p>The source of the data is <a href="http://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=akq&amp;gage=rmdv2">NOAA's
		hydrologic prediction service</a>. This app takes into account the highest value, observed or
		predicted, for the current 24-hour period.</p>
	<p><a href="http://mogrify.org/">I</a> made this app because I got tired of all the news stories
		about people getting themselves into trouble because of high water on the James. The rules are
		there for a reason; disregarding them risks not only your own safety, but that of the rescuers,
		and of anyone else in the city needing assistance when a rescue operation is underway. It also
		wastes a staggering amount of taxpayer dollars every time this happens.</p>
	<p>Apparently the clearly posted signage and readily available information are too difficult for some
		folks to digest, so my aim is to take all the guesswork out of it.</p>
	<p>I'm <a href="http://mogrify.org/">Tony Gambone</a>, and I'm lucky enough to live near the park
		and to enjoy its many great qualities. Stay safe out there.</p>
